We are currently generating, processing, and uploading data here: https://osf.io/96tvy/. OSF has a storage limit, and we are exploring alternative options. The data generation process is ongoing. The genetic algorithm is still running to achieve a better score.

In the following table, recording GPS locations for larger datasets is time-consuming. We provide configurations with the dataset to enable regeneration if necessary.

The following table provides information for the generated data. We run the data generation for the top 10 parameter sets, and the ones that have already been generated and calculated are provided here. As the data generation finishes, we will update the data statistics here
